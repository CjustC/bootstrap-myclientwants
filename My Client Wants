My Client Wants
Hey,
I hope you're doing well.
Just heard from the client.
They're willing to pay us $2000 to build a site with the following requirements.
A large, blue header.
A 2 column layout with images of their product.
A short navbar which has an 'exciting' design.
Lots of Bootstrap badges
One huge 'buy now' button at the bottom. It should do something fancy when they hover over it.
A footer with lots of buttons and images.
Is that cool?
Let me know ASAP. Thanks!
